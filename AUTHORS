Authors of txt2pdbdoc (formerly unixdoc)

Paul J. Lucas: performed major clean-up of the text-to-Doc code;
converted it from C++ to C since C++ isn't really needed for this code
and having it in C increases portability; wrote documentation.

Christopher Heschong: original author for HTML-to-text conversion.

Harold Bamford: fixed portability problem with sizeof struct's.

Rick Bram & Florent Pillet: Original authors.
